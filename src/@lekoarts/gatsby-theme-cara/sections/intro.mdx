# Saeb Monument
In Isfahan, there is a district named Tabriziha (Tabriz is a city in the north-west of Iran). The reason for this is that, during Safavid-era, Shah Abbas moved his capital from Tabriz to Isfahan then his acquaintances immigrated to Isfahan.
Shah Abbas helped to build a district in Isfahan so the emigrants could reside there. Saeb Tabrizi is one of the immigrants who moved to Isfahan with Shah Abbas.  He is known as one of the greatest sonneteer of his century and the most famous poet of Safavid-era
